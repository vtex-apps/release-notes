# Submenu behavior

The Menu component’s expanding behavior was improved for mobile.

## What has changed

Previously, when a submenu was triggered, the Menu component did not exhibit a user-friendly behavior. Its frame size would not expand, displaying a scroll-bar anytime a user needed to click on something in a submenu.

At present, the frame is expanded regardless of the size hierarchical level of the sub-menu being clicked on.
