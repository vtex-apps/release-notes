- [Telemarketing Login](https://github.com/vtex-apps/telemarketing/pull/52) - Before this fix, when logging in to a store which had a telemarketing profile, users would encounter problems in rendering the Menu component, which would have stayed behind the Search Bar.
- [Buy-button redirect](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-discussion/issues/64) - The Buy Button no longer redirects users to an empty cart when the request to add a product to the cart take too long. ℹ️This behavior only was enabled when `isOneClickBuy` was set to `true`.

- [Storefront carousel schema](https://github.com/vtex-apps/carousel/pull/82) - Carousel schema was reordered in the Admin’s Storefront section in order for image uploads to be displayed first.
- [Icon button inside forms](https://github.com/vtex/styleguide/pull/742) - With this bug fix, you can use an icon button inside a `<form>` without it automatically becoming a submit, saving the form when clicked.
- [Duplicated Minicart items](https://github.com/vtex-apps/minicart/pull/174) - When the same item is repeatedly added by a user to the Minicart, the component will henceforth take the added quantity into account without displaying any bugs.
