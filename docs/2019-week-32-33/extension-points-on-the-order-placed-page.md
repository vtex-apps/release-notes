# Extension points on the Order Placed page

The Order Placed page can now accept new components to its upper part thanks to the use of extension points.

## Main advantages

The extension points allow the page’s layout to become flexible. This means that you can now customize the upper part of the Order Placed page, without having to worry about breaking the layout because of the changes to the components’ rigid build.

## What you need to do

In order to be able to customize the Order Placed page using extension points, ensure that your store is already running [**Order Placed**](https://github.com/vtex-apps/order-placed) version **1.4.0** or higher.
