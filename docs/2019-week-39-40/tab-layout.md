# Tab Layout

Tab Layout is a layout structure that allows the construction of custom layouts within each tab present in your store. 

![tab-layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52087100/66661201-fc70c880-ec1c-11e9-8387-3fea98f59e3c.png)
_Example of an brazilian VTEX store with tabs displaying different content. With Tab Layout, you can easily define a layout for each of these tabs_. 

## Main advantages

With Tab Layout, your store's layout gains more **versatility**. This is because before we had the Tab Layout, be it [Flex](https://vtex.io/docs/components/general/vtex.flex-layout) or [Stack](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.stack-layout) layout, stores could only create a single layout for them at a time. 

Tab Layout allows store to have tabs with different content each one. Therefore, **creating different layouts within the store's main layout becomes possible** :tada: 

## What you need to do
