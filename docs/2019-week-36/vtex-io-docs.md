## Content

### Getting Started

In the Getting Started section, you can learn what VTEX IO is and take your first steps onto the platform, developing your own store theme by yourself. 

- [**What is VTEX IO**](https://vtex.io/docs/getting-started/what-is-vtex-io/1) 
- [**Build stores with VTEX IO**](https://vtex.io/docs/getting-started/build-stores-with-store-framework/1) 

### Recipes

In Recipes, you have the step by steps that will help you achieve any goal on the platform. With this in mind, these tutorials are divided into three categories:

- [**Style**](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/style) - To customize your store’s style.
- [**Layout**](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/layout) - To configure the structure of your store components.
- [**Store Management**](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store) - To manage your store’s content.

### Components

Similar to the recipes, the VTEX IO components can also be found in VTEX IO Docs and are divided according to their functionalities within stores:

- [**General**](https://vtex.io/docs/components/general) -  List of all available general components your store can use.
- [**Navigation**](https://vtex.io/docs/components/navigation) - Components linked to the user's browsing experience.
- [**Product Related**](https://vtex.io/docs/components/product-related) - Components tasked with rendering your store’s product data.
- [**Pixel**](https://vtex.io/docs/components/pixel) - Components used to collect user data for a third-party of your choosing. 
- [**Search Related**](https://vtex.io/docs/components/search-related) - Search-related platform components. 

### Latest Releases

Our GitHub **Release Notes** now also in VTEX IO Docs! Although the link to all the releases still points to GitHub, it's only a matter of time until our releases get an site interface of their own :tada: 

## Coming soon

- **More recipes** - For now, we are aware that we have a lot to document. Therefore, our most important next step is to increase our recipe base. You can and should contribute with any know-how that you already have by opening a Pull Request, as well as asking for anything that's missing in our [Store Discussion](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-discussion).
- **Search engine** - To enable users to search for any desired recipe or component.
- **Resources** section - We aim to offer a theoretical knowledge database liked to practical recipes exercises.
- **Multi-language support** - The website content will also be available in Spanish and Portuguese.
- **Content for apps development** - We are working on creating an entirely new environment focused on VTEX IO users that are developing apps on the platform.
