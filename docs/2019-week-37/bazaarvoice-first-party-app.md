# Bazaarvoice first party app

Easily integrate your store with the [Bazaarvoice](https://www.bazaarvoice.com/) solution by simply using the VTEX IO Bazaarvoice first party integration app. 

ℹ️ The Bazaarvoice is a solution that used to highlight the customer’s buying experience to retailers, improving their understanding related to customer feedback, rating, review, Q&A, etc.

## What has changed

Previously, a native integration with the Bazaarvoice solution did exist, but was not behaving as expected when used by stores.  

Now, in addition to functioning at full speed, the native integration also received a new layout a secondary rating values to grade users with more than just the traditional score.

## Main advantages 

Our native app ensures that retailers integrate their VTEX IO store with the Bazaarvoice solution in a better, faster and easier way.

:warning: **Installing the Bazaarvoice app does not automatically contract Bazaarvoice services**, but merely provides a native integration together with a solution. It is therefore only available to those that already use this solution in their store.

## What you need to do

In order to natively integrate your store with the Bazaarvoice solution, simply follow the steps below:

1. In the desired account's admin **Apps**, install the **Bazaarvoice app**.

2. Make sure the [**product review blocks**](https://github.com/vtex-apps/product-review-interfaces/tree/master/example) are available in your store's theme so the app can run properly.

Having completed these steps, your store is ready to use the native integration.
