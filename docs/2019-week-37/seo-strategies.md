# SEO strategies

Check out our SEO improvements compilation below, which the team has been working on for the past couple of weeks. The goal is to enable your store to attain a higher search engine ranking, thereby boosting web traffic to your site :rocket:

:eyes: No action for the releases below is warranted on your side. The performance improvement is already available to all VTEX IO users!

## Sitemap Optimization

Previously, VTEX IO stores Sitemap (automatically generated by the VTEX Catalog system) included site URLs with QueryString, such as the URL of a subcategory page with applied filters. 

The drawback for this type of mapping is that a large number of specific Sitemap pages can lead to important store pages losing their relevance when ranked by search engines. 

Therefore, all VTEX IO stores now have a **reduced Sitemap** that only displays the store’s main pages.

## URLs encoding removal 

**All** IO store URLs were encoded so that special characters could be read by the server, even when such characters were already readable and didn't need to be encoded. 

URLs containing illegible characters remain encoded. However, this release **removes the encoding from characters which are allowed by the server**, making your site's URLs more user friendly. 

:information_source: Character that the server allows and that are no longer encoded are alphanumerical and special characters such as <code>$</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>!</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>'</code>, <code>(</code>, <code>)</code> and <code>,</code>.

## Lower case URLs 

In addition to removing the above-mentioned encoding, the **site's URL segments now are in lower case**, with the exception of segments related to product and SKU specification filters.  

This exception is due to product and SKU specifications data entry fields being case sensitive, unlike brands, categories and so on. For example, there may be two specifications of the same name whose only difference is the capital letter in one of them. 

:eyes: In order to force all your site's URL segments - even [product](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/setting-up-product-specification-fields--tutorials_271) and [SKU](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/setting-up-sku-specifications--2AnTdsMR60iyA0YIuq2w68) specifications to use lower case, simply add all the store's specifications in Catalog in lower case.

## Canonical tags in Server Side Rendering

Because of a bug, a store's Canonical tags were only present in Client Side Rendering. This resulted in tags not appearing in the Page Source, only being visible when using the Inspect tool.

With this fix, **all Canonical tags are available both Client Side as well as Server Side**, ensuring that page Canonical tags verification performed by Google is not hindered. 

---

## Canonical tags in custom pages

**Custom pages now have their own Canonical tags**. With this improvement, Google's verification for indexing store URLs is not hindered: it is now able to inspect custom pages and use their Canonical tag for indexing as recommended as a best practice.

This allows stores with custom page to gain flexibility to use custom URLs on page as well, without having to worry about their forced indexing by Google.

## Dynamic Title tag

This improvement allows **page Title tags to include applied filters during browsing**, in addition to dynamically indicating the lowest category tree hierarchical level that the user is in.

Previously, page Title tags were limited to showing only the last category tree hierarchical level that the user was browsing, without dynamically indicating user navigation within that level.

:information_source: Since title tags define search engine result titles, it is very important for these to be dynamic in order to avoid them being the same Title tag for pages with different content.
