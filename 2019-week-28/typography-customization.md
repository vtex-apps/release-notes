# Typography customization

Storefront now allows you to customize your store's typography in a faster and easier way using admin.

## What has changed

Previously, when customizing a store's custom Style using Storefront's __Design__ section, you could only edit colors.

With the new feature, you can also edit and customize the typography used in a store through your admin. Simply edit the desired store style and select the __Typography__ option.

Inside this section in __Font Family__, you can add fonts of your choosing that you can use in your store's theme, as well as applying these fonts to text content, in __Type Token__.
